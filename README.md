talk like banana :P


Imagine how would a minion talk in the real world, some reports and fans are asserting that a good number of the words are translatable and actually do make sense. 
Many have noticed that several Minionese terms originated from languages like Spanish, Filipino, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese.
Well I guess you didn't see that coming, did you?

The site is deployed on netlify go have a look and wait if a error pops out it takes time for certain APIs to generate data so everything is cool.
Will make some changes in coming future :)
